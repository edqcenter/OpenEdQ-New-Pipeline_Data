# OpenEdQ-New-Pipeline_Data
Open scripts for working with ERS data.

- Most scripts are written as one common table expression (CTE) to implement a single unit of business logic, such as modifying a field to show 'New', 'Continuing', or 'Returning' students.
- The file structure and data types of the final script, 5, follow the the structure as the ERS files received from
the Institutional Research and Analyses team at the CO.
